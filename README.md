# Exploratory Transcriptomic Analysis of Allergic Rhinitis

This repository contains an exploratory re-analysis of publicly available
microarray gene expression data examining pathway-level immune signals and
molecular heterogeneity in allergic rhinitis.

The work is intentionally exploratory and hypothesis-generating. It does not
introduce new experimental data, clinical claims, or diagnostic assertions.

## Contents

- `analysis/`  
  Jupyter notebook used for data loading, preprocessing, statistical testing,
  and visualization.

- `figures/`  
  Figures generated from the analysis, including differential expression and
  variance comparisons.

- `manuscript/`  
  PDF manuscript describing the analysis, results, and interpretation.

- `data/`  
  Information on the publicly available datasets used.

## Data Source

Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO):  
GSE19187  
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE19187

All data used are publicly available and de-identified.

## Scope and Limitations

This analysis is exploratory in nature and intended to characterize signal
structure and heterogeneity within existing data. Findings should be interpreted
as hypothesis-generating and not as confirmatory or clinically actionable.
